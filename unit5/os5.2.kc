  XXX - To make your life easier, do something like char *pn=p->process_name

        in a loop to copy the name into place.

  // corresponding to the PDB number
  XXX - Set p->storage_start_address to the correct start address
  for a process that is in this PDB.

  XXX - Set the stack pointer to $01FF
  (This requires a bit of fiddly pointer arithmetic, so to save you 
  the trouble working it out, you can use the following as the left 
  side of the expression:   *(unsigned short *)&ss[x] = ...
  where x is the offset of the stack pointer low byte (SPL) in the
  Hypervisor saved state registers in Appendix D of the MEGA65 User's
  Guide. i.e., if it were at $D640, x would be replaced with 0, and
  if it were at $D641, x would be replaced with 1, and so on.
  XXX - Note that the MEGA65 User's Guide has been updated on FLO.
  You will required the latest version, as otherwise SPL is not listed.

  XXX - Set the program counter to $080D
  (This requires a bit of fiddly pointer arithmetic, so to save you 
  the trouble working it out, you can use the following as the left 
  side of the expression:   *(unsigned short *)&ss[x] = ...
